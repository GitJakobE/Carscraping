# Carscraper
This minor project takes a car site and scrapes it for cars for sale. One can then use the car prices in the past and present to find the best car to buy compared to the other cars. This is done using ML in sci-kit learn. If we keep scarping we can also get trends for when different cars will drop in value compared to when they were released.
